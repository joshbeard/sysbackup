sysbackup is a simple shell script that uses rsync to perform backups.

I need to create incremental backups that match the live data's heirarchy as such:

Live data:
	homes/
		- dept1/
			- staff
			- others
		- dept2
		- dept3

Backup Data:
	/data/backups/homes/
		- dept1
			- 2012-01-31
			- 2012-01-30
			- 2012-01-29
			- Latest -> 2012-01-31
		-dept2
			....

This allows me to share the backup data using standard sharing protocols (AFP, SMB, NFS)
and for users to easily browse the backups to drag/drop their data.


This was a quick hack to get a job done and is, in no way, perfect.
